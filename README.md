DESCRIPTION
===========
This project is a C# Windows Forms application that allows users to select a CSV file containing raw financial market data from any organization available at Yahoo Finance and will display a chart of stock candlesticks. The program consists of a Candlestick class, a derived SmartCandlestick class which can detect single-candlestick patterns regarding 
different financial behavior, and utilizes Visual Studio's IDE objects to offer a user-friendly interface with graphical representation of data.

FEATURES
========
- SmartCandlestick class: Implements object-oriented principals such as inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism by dynamically binding a collection of objects to a chart for pattern recognition.
- Chart Annotations: Allows for user-defined selections of highlighting specific financial recurrences displayed on the stock chart.
- Event Handlers: Event-driven actions respond efficiently to user's selection of graphical components.

DEPENDENCIES
============
This project relies on the installment of Visual Studio and the ability to run a Windows operating system.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
================
This project was inspired by the statistics of the financial stock market and the important of pattern recognition to better equip users with insights into market sentiment and potential price movements.
